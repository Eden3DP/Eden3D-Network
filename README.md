# FAQ
Q: What is the Eden3D Network?
---
A: Eden3D Network is a community-driven webapp to coordinate users, designers and 3D printers together to build great things in a decentralized manner. All are paid in Sats.

Q: What does this Network do?
---
A: Our network assists in coordinating users, 3D designers and 3D printers together in one place, where users can find designers and/or printers to create and build their requests.

Q: What is the purpose of the Eden3D Network?
---
A: The main purpose of the Eden3D Network is to bridge the skills needed to help bring ideas to life. We wanted a place where people can submit a request, and that request is fulfilled by either being designed and/or printed, therefore digitally delivered, or if 3D printed the product can be shipped to you or picked up locally. 


Q: How stupid. Why would I want to use this Network when there is other sites to use on the web!?
---
A: Why wouldn't you want to use the Eden3D Network to coordinate with other designers & printers to build your idea, then locally pick up the part or have the part shipped to you, aying for the work in Sats? This was designed by us, for us. We are simply sharing it with the world and excited to recieve any feedback to make the proper improvments where necessary in upcoming versions. We're most excited for the self-hosted distributed network option to download in the coming months.  Thank you for any constructive criticism and feedback. It's greatly appreciated.
